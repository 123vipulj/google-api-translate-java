Provides a simple, unofficial, Java client API for using Google Translate.

Features:
=========

Small library size - less than 50Kb.

Uses English as an intermediate language to attempt translations between language pairings that are unsupported directly by Google Translate.

The jar is runnable and has a very lightweight GUI to demonstrate translation functionality.

Quickstart:
===========

import com.google.api.translate.Language;
import com.google.api.translate.Translate;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // Set the HTTP referrer to your website address.
    Translate.setHttpReferrer(/* Enter the URL of your site here */);

    String translatedText = Translate.execute("Bonjour le monde", Language.FRENCH, Language.ENGLISH);

    System.out.println(translatedText);
  }
}
